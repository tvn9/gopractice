The Go Programming Language, also commonly referred to as Golang, 
is a general-purpose programming language, developed by a team at Google.
The Go language was conceived in September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, 
Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google. 
Go first appeared in November 2009, and the first version of the language
was released in December 2012. The official web site of the Go project is 
http://golang.org/. Go has its own elegance and programming idioms that 
make the language productive and fun to code. Go also provides a 
comprehensive standard library. The standard library provides all 
the core packages programmers need to build real-world, web and 
network-based programs. Go is a statically typed, natively compiled, 
garbage-collected, concurrent programming language that belongs primarily 
to the C family of languages in terms of basic syntax.
